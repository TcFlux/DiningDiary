# DiningDiary
How many times have you been to a restaurant you've been before and completely forgotten what dishes you've previously tried or how much you liked them? For me, it happens all the time. I'm making this little project so that I can keep track of which restaurants I've been to, what I dishes I tried there, and to keep track of the things that I liked or disliked!


## Design Deliverables
### Basic
  1. __Select a restaurant to add to your list of visited__
      * Be able to input:
        * name
        * picture (upload or link)
        * address
        * personal rating (or rating calculated from the rating of the dishes) 
        * type of restaurant 
        * add a personal review or description (maybe have sections? i.e. service, environment, facilities)
      * Maybe integrate with yelp or gmaps and have an autocomplete functionality
      
  2. __Be able to add dishes to the restaurant__
      * Be able to input:
        * name
        * picture (upload or link)
        * type of dish
        * personal rating
        * note
