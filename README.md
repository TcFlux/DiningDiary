# DiningDiary
How many times have you been to a restaurant you've been before and completely forgotten what dishes you've previously tried or how much you liked them? For me, it happens all the time. I'm making this little project so that I can keep track of which restaurants I've been to, what I dishes I tried there, and to keep track of the things that I liked or disliked!
